Hello! My name is Daniil, and I'm a student of Political Science who decided to change my career path to programming. Currently, I am self-learning and actively developing my programming skills.

Education:
- Incomplete higher education at Akademia Ekonomiczna-Humanistyczna in Warsaw, Poland, specializing in Political Science. My background in humanities allows me to approach problem-solving analytically and work effectively with data.

Courses and Learning:
- Completed the course "Introduction to Python" on Stepik platform. This course provided me with the foundations of Python programming and introduced me to the core concepts of the language.(https://stepik.org/course/58852/syllabus)
- Studied the basics of software testing process and principles through self-learning. This gave me a solid understanding of testing methodologies and techniques.(https://stepik.org/course/118842/syllabus)
- Deepened my knowledge of testing principles and gained familiarity with additional testing tools during the course (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJdZUyk47gjta2JkSGPDtXsbZpnG4C0q/edit). This course expanded my understanding of test automation, test frameworks, and other tools commonly used in testing.

Skills and Interests:
- I have a basic level of proficiency in Python programming language and I am familiar with testing principles. I am keen on utilizing Python for test automation and creating reliable and efficient automated tests.
- I have experience working with various third-party service APIs, such as :
  
OpenAI API: I have experience using the OpenAI API, which provides access to powerful natural language processing models like GPT-3. It allows developers to integrate advanced language generation capabilities into their applications.

YouTube API: I have utilized the YouTube API, which enables developers to interact with YouTube's features and retrieve data from the platform. This API allows tasks such as searching for videos, retrieving video details, managing playlists, and accessing user information.

Telegram API: I have worked with the Telegram API, which allows developers to build chatbots and interact with the Telegram messaging platform. This API provides methods for sending and receiving messages, managing chats and groups, and utilizing various Telegram features.. You can find the projects where I utilized these APIs in my GitHub repositories.
- I am also familiar with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and OpenAI projects. I have explored the applications of AI in different domains, and I have enjoyed experimenting with AI projects based on OpenAI models.
- I have experience using Git for version control and GitHub for collaborative development. I understand the fundamental concepts of version control and I am comfortable working with branches, commits, and merges.
- Furthermore, I have a small amount of experience in data processing and analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- In addition, while creating the web parser, I also gained some familiarity with HTML. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and structuring their content. Understanding HTML is essential for parsing and extracting data from web pages, as it provides the structure and elements of the page. Although my experience with HTML is basic, it allowed me to effectively navigate and extract information from the targeted web page during the development of the parser.

Objective and Intention:
- My primary goal is to specialize in test automation. I aim to apply my programming skills and testing knowledge to create robust and automated test scenarios.
- I am interested in gaining practical experience and growth in the field of software development. I am ready to take on challenges and tasks related to programming and I strive to develop myself as a Junior Python Developer.

Languages:
- Russian (native)
- Belarusian (native)
- English (Level A2 certified, but my proficiency has significantly improved since the exam. I have been actively using English in various contexts, including programming and communication with international colleagues and clients.)
- Polish (Level A2 certified, but my language skills have advanced considerably since the time of the certification. As evidence of my proficiency, I am currently pursuing my education in a Polish-language university program.)

About me:
I am a dedicated and enthusiastic learner, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. With a strong foundation in programming and a passion for automation testing, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative projects. I am a detail-oriented and collaborative team player, always striving for excellence in my work. My diverse language skills allow me to effectively communicate and collaborate with individuals from different cultural backgrounds. I am motivated to continuously improve and expand my expertise in software development and testing.

Thank you for your attention! I am ready to take on exciting tasks and opportunities for collaboration. I am committed to continuous learning and development in programming, and I believe that my skills and passion for technology will make me a valuable team member.

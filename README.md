# Hi! üëã

I'm Daniil, passionate about test automation, Python programming, and PyTest.

üå± Currently, I'm actively learning Selenium and PyTest to enhance my skills in test automation.

üìö Education:
- Incomplete higher education at Akademia Ekonomiczna-Humanistyczna in Warsaw, Poland, specializing in Political Science. My foundation in humanities enables me to approach problem-solving analytically and work effectively with data.

üéì Courses and Learning:
- Completed the "Introduction to Python" course on the Stepik platform. This course provided me with the fundamentals of Python programming and introduced me to the core concepts of the language. [Course Link](https://stepik.org/course/58852/syllabus)
- Self-studied the basics of the software testing process and principles, giving me a solid understanding of testing methodologies and techniques. [Course Link](https://stepik.org/course/118842/syllabus)
- Deepened my knowledge of testing principles and gained familiarity with additional testing tools during the course. [Course Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJdZUyk47gjta2JkSGPDtXsbZpnG4C0q/edit). This course expanded my understanding of test automation, test frameworks, and other tools commonly used in testing.

üíº Skills and Interests:
- I have a basic level of proficiency in the Python programming language and a strong grasp of testing principles. I'm passionate about using Python, PyTest, and Selenium for test automation and creating reliable and efficient automated tests.
- I have experience working with various third-party service APIs, including:
  - OpenAI API: I have experience using the OpenAI API, which provides access to powerful natural language processing models like GPT-3. It allows developers to integrate advanced language generation capabilities into their applications.
  - YouTube API: I have utilized the YouTube API, enabling developers to interact with YouTube's features and retrieve data from the platform. This API supports tasks such as video searching, retrieving video details, managing playlists, and accessing user information.
  - Telegram API: I have worked with the Telegram API, allowing developers to build chatbots and interact with the Telegram messaging platform. This API provides methods for sending and receiving messages, managing chats and groups, and utilizing various Telegram features. You can find the projects where I utilized these APIs in my GitHub repositories.
- I'm also familiar with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and OpenAI projects. I have explored AI applications in different domains and enjoyed experimenting with AI projects based on OpenAI models.
- I have experience using Git for version control and GitHub for collaborative development. I understand the fundamental concepts of version control and am comfortable working with branches, commits, and merges. Additionally, I have some experience in data processing and analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. While creating a web parser, I gained familiarity with HTML, which is essential for parsing and extracting data from web pages. My experience with HTML, although basic, allowed me to effectively navigate and extract information from web pages during the development of the parser.

üéØ Objective and Intention:
My primary goal is to specialize in test automation. I aim to apply my programming skills and testing knowledge to create robust and automated test scenarios using PyTest. I'm interested in gaining practical experience and growth in the field of software development. I'm ready to take on challenges and tasks related to programming and strive to develop myself as a Junior Python Developer.
